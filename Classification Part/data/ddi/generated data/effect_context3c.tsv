effect	Data from a cohort of patients on oral <e10> hydralazine </e10> therapy who were administered <e22> beta-blockers </e22> were retrospectively evaluated.
effect	Data from a number of studies have shown that patients receiving intravenous <e10> phenytoin </e10> or carbamazepine concurrently with <e20> piperacillin </e20> have an increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration.
effect	When <e10> amiloride </e10> is added to <e20> l-arginine </e20> or d-alanine, the renal clearance of these compounds is increased, with concomitant increases in the incidence of nephrotoxicity.
effect	When <e10> amiloride </e10> and <e20> methotrexate </e20> are given concomitantly, renal function may be impaired.
effect	When <e10> amiloride </e10> is used concomitantly with other <e22> anesthetics </e22>, the anesthetic effects may be additive.
effect	In some patients, the antihypertensive effects of <e11> VIOXX </e11> and <e20> chlordiazepoxide </e20> may be antagonized by certain drugs including certain antibiotics (e, g,, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, colistin, and sodium_colistimethate ), anticoagulants, certain steroids, monoamine_oxidase_inhibitors, procainamide, and thiazide_diuretics.
effect	In some patients, <e10> dexamethasone </e10> has been shown to reduce the beneficial effects of <e20> probenecid </e20> and reserpine.
effect	In some patients, concurrent use of <e10> indomethacin </e10> and <e22> beta_adrenergic_blocking_agents </e22> can result in increased adverse effects and may lead to drug discontinuation.

effect	In some patients, concomitant use of <e10> clindamycin </e10> and <e20> furosemide </e20> may result in a high risk of serious gastrointestinal ulceration.
effect	Since <e10> indomethacin </e10> inhibits the proliferation of several kinds of cancer cells, in combination with other <e22> anticancer_drugs </e22>, such as cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, or etoposide, this combination could enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy.
effect	Since <e10> indomethacin </e10> increases platelet function in vitro, patients receiving <e20> indomethacin </e20> and/or its derivatives may require increased prothrombin times for the same prothrombin time.
effect	Since <e10> indomethacin </e10> and <e20> diflunisal </e20> may interact, diflunisal, in particular, should be used with extreme caution in patients on indomethacin.
effect	Since <e10> indomethacin </e10> has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of a variety of normal and malignant cells, in patients receiving <e20> dexamethasone </e20> or other steroidal_antagonists, the concomitant use of indomethacin with other antineoplastic_agents, or other anticoagulants, may increase the risk of bleeding.
effect	Since <e10> indomethacin </e10> inhibits the activity of all <e22> prostaglandin </e22> synthesis inhibitors, and the inhibitory effect of indomethacin is additive with all NSAIDs, the concomitant use of indomethacin and a prostaglandin_inhibitor (such as diclofenac ) is contraindicated.

effect	Renal clearance measurements using <e11> SPRYCEL </e11> or <e22> CELIA </e22> may need to be adjusted for diuretic and NSAID effects.
effect	Renal clearance measurements may be influenced by <e10> cyclosporine </e10> and <e22> sulfonylureas </e22>.
effect	Renal clearance measurements obtained with <e11> INDOCIN </e11> revealed that <e20> epinephrine </e20> increased renal clearance of renin and metanephrine (with concurrent reduction in renal clearance of norepinephrine ), but did not affect the renal clearance of either epinephrine or norepinephrine.
effect	Renal clearance measurements with <e12> cephalosporins </e12> may be inaccurate because <e21> PRINIVIL </e21> is more potent than cephalosporins, especially when administered concomitantly.
effect	Renal clearance measurements using <e10> methotrexate </e10> and <e20> cytochrome P-450_inhibitor </e20> formulations did not reveal any change in pharmacokinetics with concomitant use of the two formulations.
effect	Therefore, patients receiving <e10> Nabilone </e10> concomitantly with other <e22> psychotropic_agents </e22> may require increased sedative or hypnotic effects.
effect	Therefore, patients receiving <e10> phenylbutazone </e10>, concomitant with <e20> cyclopropane </e20>, may develop respiratory depression and hypoxemia, possibly due to inhibition of pulmonary metabolism of the drugs by phenylbutazone.

effect	It is, however, possible that the reduction in arterial dilation caused by <e10> norepinephrine </e10> may be greater when <e20> epinephrine </e20> is given concomitantly.
effect	It is, however, possible that the increased hepatic toxicity of <e11> BROVANA </e11> may have been caused by its hepatic antitumor activity and its in vitro antitumor effect, as previously reported, was not seen when <e22> cisplatin </e22> was used alone.
effect	It is, however, unknown whether <e10> astemizole </e10>, alone or in combination with <e22> antipsychotic_agents </e22>, could induce CNS-depressant effects, such as hallucinations and delusions, in schizophrenia patients.

effect	- Methotrexate (e,g,, <e10> cyclophosphamide </e10> )-or other <e22> antineoplastic_agents </e22> may prolong the half-life of myocardial_depressants such as valdecoxib, for example, prolonging the half-life of a single subcutaneous dose of a single myocardial_depressant by approximately 11 hours.
effect	- Methyldopa (e,g,, dopa_mesylate ), <e10> reserpine </e10>, veratrum_alkaloids, and monoamine_oxidase_inhibitors may decrease the efficacy of <e22> tricyclic_antidepressants </e22>.
effect	- Methyldopa (e,g,, <e10> caffeine </e10> ) has been shown to increase the effect of <e20> metyldopa </e20>.
effect	- Phenytoin (e,g,, <e10> phenylbutazone </e10> ) has been reported to produce CNS depression in a number of clinical studies and has been shown to increase the CNS depressant effect of <e22> sympathomimetics </e22> such as barbiturates.
effect	ACE-inhibitors :Reports suggest that <e11> PRINIVIL </e11> may enhance the effects of <e22> ACE-inhibitors </e22>.
effect	Furosemide : Clinical studies in patients receiving <e10> furosemide </e10> concomitantly with other <e22> nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs </e22> and antihistamines have shown that they reduce the efficacy of histamine_H2_blocking_agents such as chlordiazepoxide and reserpine.
effect	Furosemide : Clinical studies have shown that <e10> hydrochloroquine </e10> may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration when given with <e20> furosemide </e20>.
effect	Furosemide : Clinical studies have shown that <e10> furosemide </e10> may inhibit the efficacy of <e20> diclofenac </e20>, sodium_cephalothin_sulfate, and quinidine.
effect	Furosemide : Clinical studies have shown that <e10> fentanyl </e10> and <e20> furosemide </e20> have additive effects on the central nervous system.
effect	Furosemide : Clinical studies have shown that <e12> aminoglycosides </e12> may potentiate the effects of <e22> antiretroviral </e22> s.
effect	Furosemide : Clinical studies suggest that <e10> furosemide </e10> may interfere with the effects of <e22> beta-adrenergic_blocking_agents </e22>, such as propranolol.
effect	<e10> Valdecoxib </e10> may increase the CNS-depressive effect of certain <e22> psychotropics </e22>, including alcohol, barbiturates and narcotic_analgesics.
effect	<e10> Valdecoxib </e10> may decrease the blood clotting time when coadministered with <e20> heparin </e20>.
effect	<e10> Valdecoxib </e10> may enhance the effects of nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs ( NSAIDs ), <e22> salicylates </e22>, and other nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs.
effect	In these patients, <e10> epinephrine </e10> may enhance the actions of <e22> antihypertensive_drugs </e22>.
