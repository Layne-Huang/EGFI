advise	<e11> ISUPREL </e11> should not be used with other <e22> beta-blocking_agents </e22>.
advise	<e11> ISUPREL </e11> should not be administered concurrently with <e22> CYP3A4_antagonists </e22>.
advise	If <e10> isradipine </e10> is used in combination with <e22> lithium </e22>, an increase in lithium concentrations should be observed.
advise	Based on the results of the current investigation, there is no reason to alter the recommended dose of <e11> VIRACEPT </e11> when used in combination with <e22> anticoagulants </e22>.
advise	Cyclosporine, <e10> digoxin </e10>, and <e20> tacrolimus </e20> should not be coadministered.
advise	Itraconazole plasma concentrations should be monitored closely when <e10> itraconazole </e10> is administered with <e21> itraconazole </e21>.
advise	Therefore concomitant administration of <e11> VIRACEPT </e11> with <e20> ergotamine </e20> is contraindicated.
advise	It is, therefore, recommended that <e11> VIRACEPT </e11> not be used in combination with <e20> warfarin </e20>.
advise	Therefore, concurrent use of <e11> VIRACEPT </e11> and <e20> ketoconazole </e20> is not recommended.
advise	Therefore, the combination of <e10> cephalexin </e10> with <e20> rifampin </e20> should be avoided in patients receiving aminoglycosides.
advise	It is recommended to avoid the concomitant use of <e10> carbamazepine </e10> and <e22> lamotrigine </e22>.
advise	Because of reports of increased serum triglyceride levels in patients treated with <e11> VIRACEPT </e11>, the lipid lowering and triglyceride-lowering drug, <e20> sirolimus </e20>, should be discontinued prior to initiating VIRACEPT.
advise	Close observation of the patient is advised during the course of therapy with <e10> diflunisal </e10> and <e20> zafirlukast </e20>.
advise	<e11> Chirocaine </e11> should be administered with caution to patients receiving <e20> triazolam </e20> because of potential hepatotoxicity.
advise	Interactions with Mixed_Agonist/Antagonist_Opioid_Analgesics : Caution should be exercised when administering or taking <e10> nalbuphine </e10> with other opioids of the class used in sedative, anesthetic, and cardiac_depressant (including but not limited to <e20> nalbuphine </e20>, fentanyl, morphine, and enflurane ) agents, as these agents may prolong the QT interval and increase heart rate.
advise	Interactions with Mixed_Agonist/Antagonist_Opioid_Analgesics : Caution should be used when administering <e10> fentanyl </e10> with <e22> mixed_agonist_opioid_analgesics </e22>.
advise	Therefore, # to # hours after co-administration of <e10> ketoconazole </e10> with <e20> rifampin </e20>, the dose of rifampin should be reduced by approximately 50% and co-administration of ketoconazole is not recommended.
advise	If it is necessary to increase the dosage of <e10> phenytoin </e10>, it is advised to start <e20> diltiazem </e20> at the first dose and to increase the dosage thereafter.
advise	It is recommended that <e10> ibuprofen </e10> not be used in combination with <e20> methotrexate </e20>.
advise	Therefore, when <e10> pentazocine </e10> is administered with other <e22> CNS_depressants </e22> (e,g,, barbiturates, opioids, sedatives, anesthetics, and anesthetics ), the prothrombin time should be closely monitored.
advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking <e10> haloperidol </e10> concomitantly with <e20> rifampin </e20>.
advise	Thus, when <e12> anticoagulants </e12> are used with <e22> alosetron </e22>, the level of anticoagulant should be closely monitored and adjusted according to the patient's needs.
advise	Because of the high potential for interactions, such as, e,g,, <e10> escitalopram </e10> and <e20> amantadine </e20>, caution should be used when administering # mg of escitalopram / # mg of amantadine concurrently.
advise	<e10> Nabilone </e10> should be administered with caution to patients receiving systemic <e22> anticholinergic </e22> therapy.
advise	Caution should be exercised if <e11> CANCIDAS </e11> is given concurrently with <e20> indinavir </e20>.
advise	Concomitant administration of <e10> warfarin </e10> with <e20> sirolimus </e20> is contraindicated.
advise	Concomitant administration of <e10> flecainide </e10> and <e22> itraconazole </e22> is contraindicated because of the potential for synergistic toxicity.
advise	Caution should be exercised if <e10> ketoconazole </e10> is given with <e20> ergot_alkaloids </e20> since ergot_alkaloids may inhibit ergotamine clearance.
advise	Because there is a theoretical basis for the anti-inflammatory action of coumarin compounds, <e12> coumarin </e12> should not be administered concurrently with <e21> cyclosporine </e21> because of possible increase in drug concentrations.
advise	Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, <e11> VISTIDE </e11> should not be given to patients receiving <e20> chlorprothixene </e20>.
advise	If concomitant treatment with <e10> astemizole </e10> and <e20> ergot_alkaloids </e20> is clinically warranted, ergot_alkaloids should be discontinued 1-day prior to treatment with the concomitant agent, and the patient should be observed closely during treatment.
advise	Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With <e11> VIRACEPT </e11> Antimycobacterial_agents : Carbamazepine, itraconazole, minocycline Antimycobacterial_agents : rifampin Antimycobacterial_agents : clarithromycin, <e20> gentamicin </e20>
advise	Drugs Which Require a Lower Level of Serum Testosterone Levels: Antihistamines ( <e10> quinidine </e10> ), monoamine_oxidase_inhibitors ( such as citalopram ), phenothiazines ( <e20> rifampin </e20> ), and anesthetics ( such as halothane ).
advise	Because a similar effect is expected when <e10> flurbiprofen </e10> is administered with <e20> cimetidine </e20>, caution should be exercised if both drugs are to be administered simultaneously.
advise	therefore, <e10> nelfinavir </e10> should be taken cautiously with <e20> ritonavir </e20>.
advise	A dose adjustment of <e10> vardenafil </e10> may be required in patients on <e20> dopamine_HCl </e20>.
advise	It is recommended that <e10> bromocriptine </e10> be used cautiously in patients receiving <e20> anticholinergic_medications </e20>.
advise	These <e12> antibiotics </e12> should not be used with <e22> erythromycin </e22>.
advise	<e10> Netilmicin </e10> should not be given with other <e22> beta-blockers </e22> because netilmicin increases the beta-blocker effect.
advise	<e10> Netilmicin </e10> should be given with caution to patients receiving <e21> cisapride </e21> or quinidine because of possible additive effects.
advise	When <e10> warfarin </e10> is given with <e22> itraconazole </e22>, the plasma concentration of warfarin should be monitored to determine whether an effect is expected.
advise	Oral <e12> contraceptives </e12> should not be used with <e21> TARCEVA </e21>.
advise	A dose increase of <e11> VIRACEPT </e11> to a maximum of # mg/day is recommended when used in combination with other <e22> antiarrhythmics </e22>.
advise	If <e10> nifedipine </e10> is coadministered with other <e20> SSRIs </e20> (e,g,, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine ) or antidepressants (e,g,, imipramine ), a reduction in dose of fluvoxamine or paroxetine may be required.
advise	<e12> Multivitamins </e12> should not be taken in combination with <e22> alcohol </e22>.
advise	<e11> Videx </e11> and <e20> nevirapine </e20> should not be used concomitantly.
advise	Therefore, co-administration of <e11> VIRACEPT </e11> with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including certain antidepressants ( <e20> imipramine </e20>, nortriptyline, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram ), phenothiazines ( protriptyline, zalcitabine ), and Type_1C_antiarrhythmics ( propafenone, flecainide ), should be approached with caution.
advise	Therefore, when using <e10> ketoconazole </e10> as a sole treatment for an elevated creatine levels, it is recommended to increase plasma creatine levels by at least 0.3-0.4 fold prior to, and following, therapy with <e20> ketoconazole </e20>.
advise	This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking <e10> foscarnet </e10> concomitantly with <e21> ritonavir </e21>.
advise	Thus, when <e11> TARCEVA </e11> and <e20> ergotamine </e20> are co-administered, the ergotamine dose should be reduced by about one-third.
advise	Because of the interaction between cyclosporine and tacrolimus, it is recommended that <e10> tacrolimus </e10> be used cautiously with <e20> cyclosporine </e20>.
advise	Because of the risk of hypotension, caution should be exercised when <e10> glimepiride </e10> is given with <e20> diuretics </e20>.
advise	This interaction should be given consideration when <e10> flurbiprofen </e10> is administered concomitantly with other <e22> beta-blockers </e22> (e,g,, metoprolol, pranlukast, clarithromycin ).
advise	Patients already stabilized on <e10> ketoconazole </e10> should be observed closely to determine if they progress to <e21> ergot_alkaloids </e21> and ergotamine -containing_medications.
advise	Anticoagulant therapy should be initiated in patients receiving <e12> warfarin </e12> concurrently with <e21> FOLFIRI </e21>.
advise	These increased exposures should be considered when using <e11> VIRACEPT </e11> with <e22> VIRACEPT </e22>.
advise	Consequently, it is recommended that <e10> flurbiprofen </e10> not be administered concomitantly with other drugs known to prolong QTc intervals (e,g,, <e20> warfarin </e20>, phenytoin, or others), as these agents may increase the prothrombin time and therefore prolong the QTc interval.
advise	Concomitant use of <e10> amiodarone </e10> and <e22> ketoconazole </e22> is not recommended.
advise	If intravenous <e10> thioridazine </e10> is administered with <e21> flecainide </e21>, the dose of thioridazine should be reduced by 50% or increased by about one-third.
