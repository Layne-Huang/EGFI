mechanism	Probenecid : <e10> Probenecid </e10>, like other drugs, can decrease the absorption of <e20> norethindrone </e20>, and therefore, the effective dose of the parent drug.
mechanism	Probenecid : <e10> Probenecid </e10> reduces the hepatic metabolism of <e20> ketoconazole </e20> by increasing the levels of triazolam, alprazolam, and triazolam_hydrochloride.

mechanism	<e11> Tagamet </e11>, an oral <e22> macrolide_antibiotic </e22>, increases the prothrombin time and increases the level of coagulation factors, including fibrinogen and prothrombin time, by about 50%.
mechanism	<e11> Tagamet </e11>, in addition to its antihypertensive effect, also increases plasma levels of <e20> losartan </e20>.
mechanism	<e11> Tagamet </e11>, a Cys-Acylo_Tyr (CysTyr) analog, inhibited the in vitro metabolism of <e20> diltiazem </e20> and, as a result, increased the plasma levels of diltiazem.
mechanism	<e11> Tagamet </e11>, tetracycline, and <e20> levamisole_hydrochloride </e20> may increase the metabolism of oral contraceptives, certain antibiotics, calcium supplements, corticosteroids, corticotropin, cyclosporine, disopyramide, fluconazole, halothane, morphine, phenytoin, risperidone, methadone, quinidine, theophylline, theophylline_HCl, theophylline_HCl_b-D-glucarate, theophylline_HCl_D-mannitol, and warfarin.
mechanism	<e11> Tagamet </e11> inhibits <e20> levodopa </e20> metabolism in vivo and prevents the increase in levodopa clearance observed when metoclopramide is coadministered.
mechanism	<e11> Tagamet </e11> did not affect the pharmacokinetics of cisapride and carbamazepine in subjects with normal renal function, however, subjects with impaired renal function were observed to have reduced blood levels of <e20> cisapride </e20> and carbamazepine.
mechanism	However, a crossover study of oral <e10> phenytoin </e10> and carbamazepine tablets (1 g once daily for # days) in healthy subjects demonstrated an increase in plasma concentrations of <e20> phenytoin </e20> from # to #.5 microM when carbamazepine was coadministered.
mechanism	However, a crossover study with theophylline did not reveal an effect of <e10> theophylline </e10> on the bioavailability of <e20> phenytoin </e20> or lovastatin.
mechanism	Co-administration of <e10> ketoconazole </e10>, ketoconazole_b-ring, <e20> rifampin </e20>, and aripiprazole significantly reduced the plasma concentrations of aripiprazole.
mechanism	<e12> Quinolones </e12>, including rifabutin, <e20> ciprofloxacin </e20>, and rifabutin, may inhibit the metabolism of certain antibiotics or drugs of abuse (e,g,, oxytocin, ampicillin, cimetidine, morphine, succinylcholine, and barbiturates ).
mechanism	Antacids or <e10> sucralfate </e10> that interfere with absorption of <e20> levothyroxine </e20> may decrease serum and urine levothyroxine levels and result in elevated thyroidal antibody levels.
mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of <e10> diltiazem </e10> with <e20> atorvastatin </e20> has resulted in a marked reduction in the AUC of atorvastatin, an increase in the Cmax of atorvastatin and a decrease in the AUC/F ( AUC/F ( a %) of atorvastatin).
mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of <e10> diflunisal </e10> with oral <e22> anticoagulants </e22> increased the risk of bleeding.
mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of <e10> quinidine </e10>, which has a highly binding affinity for <e20> vitamin_D </e20>, also weakens vitamin_D binding to the active site of the receptor and thus causes a reduction in the serum concentration of vitamin_D.
mechanism	Also, concomitant administration of <e10> warfarin </e10> with <e20> piperazine </e20>, a potent diuretic, increased the renal excretion of piperazine.
mechanism	Some <e12> quinolones </e12> have been reported to decrease the clearance of digoxin and <e20> insulin </e20>, resulting in a concomitant rise in blood levels.
mechanism	Some quinolones, including ciprofloxacin, exhibit a strong tendency to interact with <e10> chloramphenicol </e10>, a bacterial-antibiotic, causing a loss of clearance of <e20> chloramphenicol </e20>.
mechanism	Methotrexate Renal tubular secretion was reduced by <e10> warfarin </e10> and <e20> ketoconazole </e20>, and increased by fluconazole, methotrexate, cisapride, cimetidine, phenytoin, and diazepam.
mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: In vitro data indicate that the clearance of <e10> probenecid </e10> may be reduced by concomitant use of <e20> methylprednisolone </e20> and some multivalent cation-containing products.
mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Since the metabolism of multivalent cations can be altered by concomitant administration of drugs such as methotrexate, <e10> doxorubicin </e10>, carbamazepine, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, disopyramide, fentanyl, indomethacin, and <e20> interferon-alfa </e20>, careful monitoring of the patient is advised.

mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that multivalent cation-containing products (such as aspirin, ketoprofen, <e10> lisinopril </e10>, diclofenac, clofibrate ) have been shown to increase the absorption of <e20> warfarin </e20>, and therefore may increase the risk of warfarin-related adverse events.
mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: Concomitant administration of <e10> lithium </e10> with multivalent cation-containing products (eg, lithium carbonate, lithium sulfate, lithium-containing products with a positive lithium ion gradient such as anion-exchange_plasma-reducing_agents or cyclosporine, triazolam, <e20> phenytoin </e20> ) may lead to an elevation in serum lithium concentrations.
mechanism	Multivalent Cation-Containing Products: When <e10> carbamazepine </e10> and <e20> lithium </e20> are used concomitantly, patients should be closely observed for signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity.

mechanism	Probenecid : <e10> Probenecid </e10> markedly inhibits the in vitro metabolism of <e20> dexamethasone </e20> and other glucocorticoids.
mechanism	Theophylline : As <e10> theophylline </e10> has been reported to decrease the absorption of <e20> warfarin </e20>, the increase in the half-life of warfarin is likely to reduce the pharmacologic effect of warfarin.
mechanism	Antibiotics : In vitro data suggest that oral <e12> antibiotics </e12>, including ampicillin and tetracycline, may diminish the renal clearance of <e20> warfarin </e20>.
mechanism	Antidepressants : In one study, the addition of <e10> ketoconazole </e10> # mg to an SSRI (e,g,, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine ) significantly increased the plasma concentration of <e20> desipramine </e20>, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
mechanism	Human pharmacokinetic data suggest that the AUC of <e10> fluvoxamine </e10> is reduced by the extent of renal clearance and the metabolism of <e20> lovastatin </e20> may increase its hepatic exposure.

mechanism	In a study in healthy volunteers, coadministration of <e10> terfenadine </e10> # mg and a <e22> drug </e22> with narrow therapeutic index, such as ketoconazole (4%), fluconazole (40%), or cimetidine (10%), was associated with a mean increase in the plasma concentrations of ergotamine, a CYP3A4 substrate, of #-fold, whereas concomitant administration of the CYP3A4 inducer ergotamine and a CYP3A4 inhibitor, atazanavir, resulted in a mean decrease in the plasma concentrations of ergotamine by 8-fold.
mechanism	In a study of healthy volunteers, <e10> probenecid </e10> given concomitantly with <e20> rifampin </e20> was found to decrease rifampin plasma concentrations by a mean of -20% and increase rifampin AUC by a mean of 34%.

mechanism	Cimetidine, caffeine, and <e10> acetaminophen </e10> may increase <e20> cyclosporine </e20> levels by inhibiting sulfate-reducing enzymes.
mechanism	Although concomitant use of <e10> isoniazid </e10> and <e20> rifampin </e20> increases the risk of rifampin nephrotoxicity, the impact of rifampin nephrotoxicity on isoniazid metabolism is unknown.
mechanism	<e10> Paroxetine </e10> has been reported to decrease <e20> cimetidine </e20> plasma concentrations, and thus an increase in the AUC of cimetidine may occur.
mechanism	However, other published reports have shown that the AUC of <e10> cimetidine </e10> was significantly decreased in patients receiving <e20> ketoconazole </e20>.
mechanism	However, other published reports have demonstrated a decrease in plasma <e10> lithium </e10> concentrations when <e20> lithium </e20> was given concurrently with oral contraceptives containing progestins, a common cause of amenorrhea.
mechanism	However, other published reports have shown that <e10> phenytoin </e10> and phenobarbital, when given concomitantly with <e20> estradiol </e20>, had a tendency to increase the plasma levels of estradiol.
mechanism	<e10> Colchicine </e10> may decrease the bioavailability of <e20> furosemide </e20>, propranolol, barbiturates, or other drugs that cause elimination of bile acids (eg, vitamin_B6 ).

mechanism	Particular caution should be exercised when <e10> loxapine </e10> is administered with <e20> alcohol </e20> or other CNS_depressants, as these agents may potentiate the CNS depressant effect of loxapine.
mechanism	Digoxin : Coadministration of <e11> COREG </e11> and <e20> digoxin </e20> increased serum digoxin levels by 28%.
mechanism	Therefore, if <e10> furosemide </e10> is to be used concomitantly with <e20> ketoconazole </e20>, the ketoconazole dose should be increased to # mg/day.
mechanism	Drugs that induce hepatic enzyme systems (e,g,, amiodarone, <e10> cypermethrin </e10> ) may increase the clearance of <e20> erythromycin </e20>.
mechanism	Drugs such as digoxin, theophylline, phenobarbital, <e10> phenytoin </e10>, and corticosteroids that are highly expressed in the prostate and that inhibit the metabolism of <e20> prostate_specific_antibody </e20> s (PSA) by raising serum levels of the hormone may increase the plasma concentration of PSA and increase the risk of prostate cancer.
mechanism	<e10> Colchicine </e10> injection increases the clearance of (e,g,, <e20> phenytoin </e20> ) by about two-fold and the half-life of (e,g,, phenytoin ) by about two-fold.

mechanism	Lithium : <e10> Lithium </e10> is a potent inhibitor of the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of <e20> cimetidine </e20>.
mechanism	Protein Binding In vitro studies have shown that <e10> prazosin </e10> increases the binding of <e20> terfenadine </e20>, carbamazepine, and cisapride to protein.
mechanism	Protein Binding In vitro studies of (1) <e10> phenytoin </e10>, (2) <e20> doxycycline </e20>, and (3) indinavir against bovine serum albumin (BSA) suggest that these drugs have similar binding parameters to BSA.
mechanism	Because <e12> antacids </e12> may interfere with vitamin_D metabolism, it is recommended that <e20> vitamin_D </e20> be administered concomitantly with antacids.
mechanism	Allopurinol : The pharmacokinetics of <e10> allopurinol </e10> is increased by <e20> cisapride </e20>, likely because of increased absorption resulting in lower levels of allopurinol and, possibly, increased serum cisapride levels.
