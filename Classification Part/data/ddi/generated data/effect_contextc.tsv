effect	aBased on reports of increased adverse reactions to <e10> methotrexate </e10> in patients receiving <e22> antineoplastic_agents </e22>, the concomitant use of certain methotrexate derivatives with antineoplastic_agents is generally contraindicated.
effect	<e10> Propranolol </e10> also had additive effects with acetaminophen, caffeine, <e20> alcohol </e20>, and magnesium salts in reducing the number of painful sores induced by the intradermal injection of bromelain.
effect	Although there are only a few case reports of hypercalcemia in patients receiving <e11> LEXAPRO </e11> and <e20> rifampin </e20> concurrently, it is recommended that the prothrombin time be closely monitored.
effect	Although there are no specific data on the effect of combined <e10> hydrocodone </e10> and <e22> narcotic </e22> use, caution is indicated in the coadministration of both agents.
effect	The vasodilating effects of <e10> tadalafil </e10> and <e20> epinephrine </e20> are antagonized by nonselective_beta_adrenergic_blocking_agents, beta_blockers, diuretics, calcium_channel_blockers, NSAIDs, platelet_aggregation_inhibitors, propranolol, and retinoids.
effect	Marked symptomatic orthostatic hypotension has been reported after discontinuing <e10> epinephrine </e10> in patients receiving <e20> furosemide </e20>.
effect	The hypotensive effect of <e10> clonidine </e10> is enhanced by local <e22> local anesthetics </e22> such as procainamide.
effect	The effectiveness of the <e12> anticoagulants </e12> is diminished by certain drugs (eg, nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_agents, corticosteroids, and <e22> antihistamines </e22> ) or by certain concurrent medications (eg, salicylates ).
effect	There have been reports of hepatic toxicity associated with the concomitant use of <e10> ketoconazole </e10> and <e22> sulfonamides </e22>, including those involving the cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme.
effect	<e12> Quinolones </e12>, including methoxy_quinolones, may enhance the effect of other <e22> anticoagulants </e22>, especially potassium-sparing_diuretics.
effect	Quinolones, including <e10> clindamycin </e10>, may interfere with the absorption of <e22> corticosteroids </e22> by blocking their synthesis in the small intestine.
effect	The concomitant administration of <e10> chlorprothixene </e10> and <e20> enoxacin </e20> has been reported to produce a pronounced and transient inhibition of the acetylcholine receptors.
effect	The concomitant use of <e10> epinephrine </e10> with <e22> antihypertensive_agents </e22> can potentiate the hypotensive effects of these agents.
effect	Serious anticholinergic symptoms have been reported in patients receiving <e10> clonidine </e10> concomitantly with other anticholinergic_drugs or anticholinergic_injection_systems (eg, <e22> tricyclic_antidepressants </e22> and other beta-adrenergic_blocking_agents ).
effect	Administration of <e10> morphine </e10> may decrease the diuretic action of <e22> thyroid_products </e22>.
effect	Therefore, concurrent use of <e10> astemizole </e10> with other <e22> anticholinergics </e22> ( tricyclic_antidepressants, antipsychotics, other antidepressants, and theophylline ) may produce additive CNS depression.
effect	Vecuronium : When <e10> indomethacin </e10> was administered concomitantly with <e21> VIOXX </e21>, a similar but smaller increase in serum creatinine was observed than with indomethacin alone.
effect	Due to their narrow therapeutic index, <e12> anticonvulsants </e12> should be administered with caution to patients receiving monoamine_oxidase_inhibitors, tricyclic_antidepressants, <e22> antipsychotic_agents </e22>, or other drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase activity.
effect	ACE_inhibitors : Reports have suggested that <e11> FORADIL </e11> may reduce the diuretic effect of <e22> ACE_inhibitors </e22>.
effect	In patients with depressed mood, concomitant use of <e11> BEXTRA </e11> and <e22> antidepressants </e22> may result in higher levels of estrogens.
effect	Furosemide : Clinical studies in humans have shown that <e10> Furosemide </e10> may enhance the effects of <e22> beta-blockers </e22> and thiazide_diuretics.
effect	Furosemide : Clinical studies have shown that <e10> Nabilone </e10> may reduce the pharmacologic effect of <e20> furosemide </e20>.
effect	In single and multiple dose studies, coadministration of <e11> FLUOTHANE </e11> with oral <e22> narcotic_analgesic </e22> (e,g,, nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs or non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_biotics ) may have increased the potential for CNS depressant effects.
effect	- Methotrexate (e,g,, <e10> cisplatin </e10> ) combined with <e22> azathioprine </e22> (e,g,, pimozide ) has been associated with a high incidence of central nervous system toxicity.
effect	ACE-inhibitors :Reports suggest that <e10> enalapril </e10> may enhance the cardiac effects of <e22> beta-blockers </e22>, such as norepinephrine, and therefore, the concomitant use of enalapril with a beta-blocker is not recommended.
effect	<e10> Valdecoxib </e10> can enhance the effects of <e22> nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs </e22> and other narcotic_analgesic s.
