effect	quinolones , including <e10> drug1 </e10> , have been reported to enhance the activity of oral <e22> drug2 </e22> such as warfarin and its derivatives ( such as warfarin ) and to increase the risk of bleeding when used concomitantly .

effect	norepinephrine : <e12> drug1 </e12> can potentiate the actions of <e22> drug2 </e22> , such as theophylline and pethidine .
effect	these results suggest that <e12> drug1 </e12> may have additive effects with <e22> drug2 </e22> and other sedative / hypnotics , and that sedative / hypnotics , drug1 , and other cns _ depressants may enhance the cns depression caused by alcohol .
effect	anticoagulants : flurbiprofen : <e12> drug1 </e12> may reduce the anticoagulant effect of <e22> drug2 </e22> ( prothrombin _ inhibitors ) by increasing the tendency of the coagulation time to exceed its normal value .
effect	there are case reports suggesting that the administration of <e10> drug1 </e10> to patients receiving other <e22> drug2 </e22> may increase the effect of other drug2 .
effect	drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of <e10> drug1 </e10> include : <e22> drug2 </e22> , barbiturates , general anesthetics , and nonsteroidal _ anti - inflammatory _ drugs .
effect	in patients receiving monoamine _ oxidase _ inhibitors or tricyclic _ antidepressants , the concomitant use of <e10> drug1 </e10> with <e22> drug2 </e22> may produce additive or potentiating effects .
effect	however , the systemic administration of <e10> drug1 </e10> to the striatum or other brain regions has been shown to produce stimulant effects when given with <e22> drug2 </e22> such as chlordiazepoxide .
effect	because <e10> drug1 </e10> has an additive effect with <e22> drug2 </e22> , the concomitant use of drug1 and drug2 is contraindicated .
effect	the hypoglycemic action of <e10> drug1 </e10> may be potentiated by other <e22> drug2 </e22> such as epinephrine and norepinephrine .
effect	consider additive sedative effects , concomitant cns depression and cns hypersensitivity when <e11> drug1 </e11> is administered concomitantly with potent cns _ depressants ( e , g , , alcohol , <e22> drug2 </e22> , tranquilizers , general anesthetics ) and hypnotics , antihistamines , or other cns _ depressants .

effect	injection : <e10> drug1 </e10> potentiates the cns - depressant effect of <e22> drug2 </e22> , such as halothane and isoflurane , and may enhance the cns - depressant effect of phenothiazines and carbamazepine .
effect	in both species , the effects of <e10> drug1 </e10> and aripiprazole were greater in the presence of <e22> drug2 </e22> than in the absence of drug2 .
effect	the concurrent use of <e10> drug1 </e10> with other <e22> drug2 </e22> may cause a strong synergistic effect .

effect	since <e10> drug1 </e10> and methotrexate may have additive or potentiating effects on <e20> drug2 </e20> toxicity , these drugs may be used in combination when both drugs are given .
effect	the concurrent use of <e10> drug1 </e10> and drug2 ( <e20> drug2 </e20> ) may result in an additive cns depressant effect .
effect	therefore , the efficacy and safety of <e11> drug1 </e11> are likely to be decreased by concomitant use of other <e22> drug2 </e22> , including alcohol , barbiturates and sedatives .
effect	for these reasons , the use of <e12> drug1 </e12> in patients receiving oral <e22> drug2 </e22> may increase the risk of bleeding .
effect	although not studied in humans , the administration of <e12> drug1 </e12> to patients receiving <e20> drug2 </e20> may enhance the anticholinergic effects of drug2 .
