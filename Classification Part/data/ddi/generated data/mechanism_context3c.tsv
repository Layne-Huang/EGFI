mechanism	Co-administration of <e10> alprazolam </e10> and <e20> midazolam </e20> resulted in increased midazolam concentrations and a decrease in midazolam clearance.
mechanism	For example, since <e10> diazepam </e10> at a dose of # mg/kg (i.e., # mg #/kg total body weight) completely blocked the absorption of <e20> cyclosporine </e20>, the serum level of cyclosporine was increased by 16%, and its elimination half-life was shortened by 40%.

mechanism	For example, since <e10> rifampin </e10> is metabolized by CYP2D6, a decrease in rifampin plasma levels could result in a decrease in <e20> amprenavir </e20> plasma levels.
mechanism	For example, since it has been shown that the <e12> anticoagulants </e12> such as warfarin or its derivatives increase the clearance of <e20> carbamazepine </e20>, a ketoconazole_preparation (i,e,, the inactive metabolite of ketoconazole ) may have to be administered with carbamazepine.
mechanism	For example, since <e10> carbamazepine </e10> has been shown to have a pharmacokinetic interaction with <e20> digoxin </e20>, the two drugs may be co-administered to increase digoxin exposure.
mechanism	For example, since <e10> cisapride </e10> is in addition to <e20> ketoconazole </e20>, a daily regimen of 1,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium bromide (TTCB) tablets may result in significant increases in serum cisapride levels.

mechanism	Because oral <e12> anticoagulants </e12> may interfere with the metabolism of coumarin derivatives (preparations containing <e20> cytochrome P-450-sensitive </e20> and -insensitive, serine-type P450s ), anticoagulants may prolong and intensify the effects of coumarin and vitamin_K_antagonists.
mechanism	Because oral <e12> quinolones </e12> have been reported to inhibit the metabolism of <e20> digoxin </e20>, the potential exists for increased plasma levels of digoxin, which could increase toxicity.
mechanism	Because oral anticoagulants are reduced by coadministration of <e10> atorvastatin </e10>, it is possible that <e20> warfarin </e20> might be reduced by coadministration of these agents.

mechanism	Other Potentially Important Pharmacologically Interactions of Phenytoin : The metabolism of <e10> phenytoin </e10> may result in decreased plasma levels of <e20> guanfacine </e20> and may increase the clearance of the drug when coadministered with cyclosporine, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, rifampin, and tacrolimus.
mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drugs Drug interactions of <e10> clofibrate </e10> with <e20> phenytoin </e20>, carbamazepine, cholestyramine, diazepam, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, glyburide, heparin, phenobarbital, primidone, sertraline, telithromycin, troleandomycin ( TAO ), and warfarin have been reported.
mechanism	Other Potentially Important Drug Interactions: Antacids : <e12> Antacids </e12> inhibit the absorption of <e20> cimetidine </e20> and cause a reduction in renal clearance of its plasma levels.

mechanism	For example, since <e10> digoxin </e10> and <e20> insulin </e20> are metabolized via this same CYP1A2-catalyzed pathway, it is possible that a possible interaction between digoxin and insulin could occur by changing the blood levels of insulin and/or the clearance of digoxin.
mechanism	For example, since <e10> doxorubicin </e10> was found to inhibit <e20> amiodarone </e20> metabolism, it may be expected that an increased clearance of doxorubicin may occur with decreased renal clearance.
mechanism	For example, since <e10> rifampin </e10> is known to inhibit the metabolism of <e20> erythromycin </e20>, a drug interaction could occur for which the two drugs have the same pharmacologic effect.
mechanism	For example, since <e10> dexamethasone </e10> and retinyl_acetate are the major isomeric hormones of breastmilk, and <e20> cyclosporine </e20> is the only drug that can simultaneously increase the levels of both of these hormones, the co-administration of cyclosporine with estrogens and progestins or progestins and isoflurane in clinical practice has the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of estrogens and isoflurane by approximately 10%.

mechanism	Oral <e12> anticoagulants </e12>, such as warfarin or its derivatives, prolong the blood clotting time and may increase the risk of bleeding if <e20> enoxacin </e20> is used concomitantly.
mechanism	Because oral <e12> anticoagulants </e12> may reduce the plasma concentrations of <e20> warfarin </e20>, their use may result in lower plasma concentrations of warfarin and higher prothrombin time.
mechanism	Because oral <e12> anticoagulants </e12> interfere with the gastrointestinal absorption of <e20> vitamin_C </e20>, the concomitant use of anticoagulants with vitamin_C is contraindicated.

mechanism	Although there was a 50% reduction in <e10> zidovudine </e10> clearance in # healthy volunteers taking # mg <e20> zidovudine </e20> and # mg adenosine, it is likely that the additional blood flow seen with adenosine would be inadequate to compensate for the reduction in adenosine clearance observed with zidovudine.

mechanism	Rifampin : When <e11> aspirin </e11> is administered concomitantly with <e20> rifampin </e20>, an approximately 2-fold increase in the half-life of rifampin is observed, which may result in an increase in the concentration of rifampin required to achieve a pharmacokinetic target of # micrograms of rifampin per liter.
