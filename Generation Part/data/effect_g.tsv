effect	Concomitant use of <e12> ketoconazole </e12> should not be considered in patients with HIV infection because of the potential for HIV transmission to HIV patients when concomitant use of <e20> ethinyl-estradiol </e20> and/or acetaminophen, both of which interact with the HIV pathway, may cause a transient reduction in plasma levels of ketoconazole and other potent antiretroviral drugs. <|endoftext|>
effect	Anticonvulsants such as <e12> levodopa </e12>, aripiprazole, and aripiprazole can cause hypotensive hypotension. <|endoftext|>
effect	With the combination of <e12> amiodarone </e12> and methotrexate, these may induce an increase in the concentrations of the <e22> dihydrochloride </e22> and the resulting antihypertensive effect of methotrexate. <|endoftext|>
effect	There has been no clinical data with <e10> aspirin </e10> in patients receiving a controlled study with other medications that may interfere with or inhibit the effects of aspirin. <|endoftext|>
effect	Although <e10> alprazolam </e10> does not affect the absorption of pharmacological agents, <e20> quinidine </e20> may increase the need for cimetidine-containing formulations. <|endoftext|>

effect	The dose-dependent increase in plasma concentrations of <e10> insulin </e10> following administration of <e22> corticosteroids </e22> is due to a reduction in the decrease in plasma insulin concentrations. <|endoftext|>
effect	f <e12> corticosteroids </e12> is probably due to the increased risk of CNS toxicity associated with the use of <e20> prednisolone </e20> and other antipsychotics (eg, concomitant use of <e20> dexamethasone </e20> and corticosteroids ) with decreased CNS clearance of <e22> nelfinavir </e22>. <|endoftext|>
effect	Coadministration of <e10> carbamazepine </e10> with diazepam at the onset of an epileptic convulsion should not result in an increased risk of increased seizure frequency or hallucinations, since patients receiving a dose of <e20> carbamazepine </e20> with carbamazepine will experience hallucinations of seizure response and other hallucinations. <|endoftext|>

effect	Astroglide may reduce serum concentrations of coadministered <e10> coadministered_drugs </e10> and <e20> cimetidine </e20>. <|endoftext|>
effect	However, the following studies indicate that <e10> concomitant administration of <e22> ketoconazole </e22> with <e22> furosemide </e22> (eg, asparaginone, metoclopramide, or simvastatin ) may interfere with the therapeutic effect of concomitant use of both ketoconazole and concomitant administration of furosemide. <|endoftext|>

effect	In addition to concomitant administration of <e10> cimetidine </e10>, administration of a steady-state <e20> acetaminophen </e20> (e,g,, Kalblicone_S), which is highly potent at increasing acetaminophen concentrations, and alcohol, resulted in significantly reduced acetaminophen bioavailability (e,g,, <e22> Ketoconazole </e22> may therefore increase acetaminophen bioavailability). 
effect	<e10> Hypersensitivity_to_Antimicrobial_agents </e10> : <e20> Atropine </e20>, clonidine, azithromycin, <e22> phenobarbital </e22>, niacin, and others may increase the susceptibility to the the gastrointestinal depressant effect of <e23> methotrexate </e23>. <|endoftext|>
effect	<e10> Trileptal </e10> ( <e20> salicylates </e20>, phenytoin, and salicylates ) may decrease the clearance of <e20> tetracycline </e20> in the patient with a hypoglycemic condition (e,g,, diabetes mellitus ). <|endoftext|>
effect	When given midazolam with <e10> carbamazepine </e10>, the action of <e20> oxcarbazepine </e20> and <e20> cyclosporine </e20> is to increase the binding of <e20> azithromycin </e20> to the area under the affected tissues. <|endoftext|>

effect	As a result, chronic administration of <e10> aspirin </e10> with <e20> ketoconazole </e20> did not change the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole and did not change the pharmacodynamics of ketoconazole. <|endoftext|>
effect	Anticoagulant-preventative-like effects of niacin may be limited in patients receiving <e10> clindamycin </e10>. <|endoftext|>
effect	Since the CNS effect of <e10> cyclosporine </e10> may be mediated by the effect of other drugs and products of the CNS, it is recommended that any CNS-dependent, CNS-related, or pharmacologic CNS-specific <e20> monoamine_oxidase_inhibitors </e20> should be given concomitantly with the CNS-dependent, CNS-related, or pharmacologic CNS-related interactions. <|endoftext|>

effect	however, it may be advisable to wait at least 1 hour prior to initiating <e12> antihypertensive_drugs </e12> before initiating any treatment of muscle conduction that has been reported to increase the clearance of the <e20> catecholamines </e20> by <e22> diuretics </e22>. <|endoftext|>
effect	Because certain compounds in the combination of <e10> rifampin </e10>, but not lithium, may interact with <e20> lithium </e20>, careful monitoring of these preparations is recommended. <|endoftext|>
effect	Therefore, the following may be expected when increasing the recommended dose of <e10> cimetidine </e10>, concomitant with <e20> naltrexone </e20>, with regard to sedation: <e20> haloperidol </e20>, and # of quinidine with each dosage in combination, with concomitant administration of <e20> digoxin </e20> and quinidine, as well as # of
effect	The effects of a nontherapeutic, single oral dose of <e10> phenytoin </e10> on the metabolism of the CYP3A4 enzyme <e22> <e22> CYP3A4 </e22> and of the inhibition of the activity of CYP3A4 may be more severe in patients receiving concomitant oral <e22> phenytoin </e22>. <|endoftext|>
effect	<e12> Tylenol </e12> : Effects on Hormonal Interactions: <e20> Etonogestrel </e20> may induce anhydrous metabolism in the liver and may impair the metabolism of <e20> ketoconazole </e20> and other antacid_agents. <|endoftext|>
effect	Propranolol, <e10> nelfinavir </e10>, quinidine, paroxetine, and vitamin_C, together with phenytoin and vitamin_C may reduce the effect of <e20> propranolol </e20>. <|endoftext|>
effect	Preliminary evidence of <e12> diuretics </e12> has been reported on concomitant use of nelfinavir and <e20> haloperidol </e20>, and concomitant administration of antiarrhythmics. <|endoftext|>
effect	Caffeine - When administered concomitantly with other CNS_depressants, Caffeine can potentiate potent CNS depressant_depressants, such as <e10> benzodiazepines </e10>. <|endoftext|>
effect	Pharmacological interaction is usually seen when <e10> metformin </e10> or <e20> fluoxetine </e20> are administered concurrently, because of their lower plasma concentrations and reduced plasma levels of the AUC_inhibitors <e22> paroxetine </e22>. <|endoftext|>
effect	<e12> N-methylnitrobenzylate </e12> inhibits the metabolite CYP3A4. <|endoftext|>
effect	<|endoftext|>
effect	- A limited, controlled study was conducted with patients with <e12> bivalent_derivatives </e12> on the basis of their receiving oral <e22> rifampin </e22> and with <e22> lithium </e22> in combination with oral <e22> lithium_derivatives </e22>. <|endoftext|>
effect	Concomitant use of <e10> carbamazepine </e10> and norepinephrine_inhibitors, including <e22> barbiturates </e22>, methotrexate, clarithromycin, morphine, nifedipine, prednisolone, rifampin, salicylates, terfenadine, valproic_acid, and <e22> phenytoin </e22>,
effect	- Acetaminophen - Cholestyramine - <e10> clonidine </e10>, ibuprofen, clarithromycin, temazepam, warfarin, and warfarin. <|endoftext|>
effect	Depressants may lower serum concentrations of these metabolizing agents in the brain. <|endoftext|>
effect	Esteroidal_Agents: <|endoftext|>
effect	Therefore, caution should be exercised when using <e12> phenylbutazone </e12> or other <e22> drugs with concomitant use of phenylbutazone </e22>. <|endoftext|>
effect	The combination of diuretics such as <e10> rifampin </e10> and <e22> propranolol </e22> may potentiate the effects of <e20> anticonvulsants </e20>. <|endoftext|>
effect	No treatment or treatment-related effects were observed when <e10> K-L-ZO_RID </e10> was administered with <e20> P-NOPROLE </e20> (previously # mg), <e22> L-SYNCHRONIC_PAD </e22> (previously # mg), and PELONE (previously # mg) for # hours prior to administration of TIAH. <|endoftext|>
effect	Other pharmacodynamic and clinical studies have demonstrated an increase in the concentrations of monoamine_oxidase_inhibitors ( MAOIs ) in healthy volunteers in response to oral doses of <e10> amiodarone </e10> ( <e20> rifampin </e20> ), although these have not been conclusively demonstrated in a patient with a history of renal failure. <|endoftext|>
effect	Prolonged administration of <e12> morphine </e12> has been reported to increase the rate of CNS withdrawal, particularly, anhydride (Cmax), the narcotic metabolite of morphine, when administered concurrently with or within the duration of prolonged daily dosage of anhydride. <|endoftext|>
effect	Therefore, in vitro and in vivo studies in healthy volunteers have demonstrated that <e12> rifampin </e12> improves <e20> antihypertensive_agents </e20> by approximately 40%, and improves concomitant effects on serum <e22> antacids </e22> concentrations and concomitant administration of <e23> antihypertensive_agents </e23> (as well as oral antihypertensive_agents ). 
effect	Therefore, if concurrent administration of <e10> phenobarbital </e10> with other antibiotics, including <e20> concomitant administration of <e20> cefafloxacin </e20>, phenobarbital or a similar drug, with <e22> cefafloxacin </e22> may result in significant interactions, including increased mortality. <|endoftext|>
effect	Oral Coadministration of <e10> Phenytoin </e10> with <e20> <e22> cimetidine </e22>, cyclosporine, <e20> benzodiazepines </e20>, concomitant administration of <e22> fluoxetine </e22>, acetaminophen, or corticosteroids did not result in lower plasma concentrations of the potent CYP3A4-blocking drug prog
effect	Other medications that may decrease CYP3A4 levels, such as the antihistamines, antidepressants and nelfinavir, may be effective in reducing the drug dose. <|endoftext|>
effect	In an analysis of patients with hepatic dysfunction, including the discontinuation of caffeine or alcohol by <e12> dilligram </e12> therapy, <e20> prazosine </e20> therapy resulted in more severe hepatic dysfunction than would be expected in patients taking <e22> amiodarone </e22> alone. <|endoftext|>
effect	f <e12> FGF_sulfate </e12> in healthy volunteers may be elevated, resulting in decreased antacid efficacy, especially when compared to <e20> co-administered with <e21> digoxin </e21>. <|endoftext|>
effect	The Administration of CYP3A4 on rheumatoid arthritis should be continued with caution because the effects may be limited by <e10> antihistamines </e10> or <e22> corticosteroids </e22>. <|endoftext|>
effect	Choline_to-ACPase Interactions: Intravenous <e10> MAO_inhibitors </e10> may potentiate the clearance of intracerebral/diaphragm_blocking effects in humans. <|endoftext|>
effect	In vitro studies on rats receiving the anti-synapto-N-methyl-D-aspartate (MAO)-inhibitors concomitantly with <e11> <e20> monoamine_oxidase_inhibitors </e20> suggest that MAO is coadministered with such medications in decreasing the amount of <e22> monoamine_oxidase_inhibitors </e22> and with decreased plasma concentrations of monoamine_
