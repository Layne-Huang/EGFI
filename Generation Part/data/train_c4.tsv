mechanism	Drugs which induce CYP3A4 activity (eg, phenobarbital, rifampin, <e10> phenytoin </e10>, rifabutin ) would be expected to increase the clearance of <e20> cisapride </e20> resulting in an increase in plasma cisapride levels.

mechanism	Quinidine : Increase the metabolism of <e10> phenytoin </e10> leading to an increase in <e20> quinidine </e20> serum concentration.
mechanism	Administration of <e10> warfarin </e10> or its derivatives with <e20> ethanol </e20> results in a rapid and significant increase in the plasma concentrations of the latter two drugs, with the latter two drugs also undergoing significant metabolism in the liver and the kidney.
mechanism	Since theophylline is converted to <e10> adenosine </e10> by hepatic metabolism, the administration of <e20> adenosine </e20> may lead to an elevation of plasma and urinary concentrations of theophylline and adenosine.
mechanism	This may be due to a drug interaction between <e10> ketoconazole </e10> and <e20> indinavir </e20>, since indinavir is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 3A4 pathway.
mechanism	<e10> Probenecid </e10> increases the rate of renal tubular secretion of <e20> creatinine </e20>.
mechanism	This increase in AUC of <e10> verapamil </e10> may result in an increase in <e20> nevirapine </e20> AUC and prolongation of its plasma half-life.
mechanism	<e10> Azithromycin </e10> markedly inhibits the metabolism of <e20> cisapride </e20>, which results in a 5-fold increase in plasma cisapride levels and a 50% increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve.
mechanism	Interactions of <e10> efavirenz </e10> with other inducers of cytochrome P-450 isozymes (e,g,, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, <e20> alfentanyl </e20>, rifampin ) have been studied, and there is only one case where a small increase in the plasma concentration of efavirenz has been observed when coadministered with
mechanism	However, other studies have shown that <e10> lansoprazole </e10> may reduce plasma concentrations of some <e22> combination_hormonal_contraceptives </e22>.
mechanism	The concomitant administration of <e10> bosentan </e10> and nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_agents ( NSAIDs ) that inhibit glucuronidation of <e20> metformin </e20>, such as reserpine, will increase plasma concentrations of metformin and therefore may cause an increase in glycemic control.
mechanism	Phenobarbital : <e10> Phenobarbital </e10> increases <e20> caffeine </e20> plasma levels and may increase the excretion of caffeine in the urine.
mechanism	Therefore, when <e10> probenecid </e10> is administered with <e20> gemifloxacin </e20>, the amount of gemifloxacin that is absorbed is likely to be reduced.

mechanism	<e10> Ibuprofen </e10> (and other nonsteroial_anti-inflammatory_agents ) may delay intestinal absorption of <e20> calcium </e20>.
mechanism	Because the absorption of oral vitamin_B12 is impaired by the gastrointestinal absorption of <e10> aluminum </e10>, an antacid that reduces the gastrointestinal absorption of oral vitamin_B12 also reduces absorption of <e20> aluminum </e20>.
mechanism	Lithium : <e10> Ibuprofen </e10> markedly decreases <e20> lithium </e20> plasma levels.
mechanism	Concomitant administration of <e11> Trileptal </e11> and phenytoin (20 mg/kg) increased the plasma concentrations of <e20> phenytoin </e20> by approximately 30%.

mechanism	Protease_inhibitors : Co-administration of <e11> SULAR </e11> ( <e20> ranitidine </e20> ) increased plasma concentrations of the protease_inhibitor lovastatin by approximately 50%.
mechanism	However, multiple-dose administration of <e10> efavirenz </e10> # hours after <e20> rifabutin </e20> administration resulted in an approximately 20% decrease in the clearance of rifabutin, which may be clinically relevant.
mechanism	Drugs that cause significant sustained elevation in gastric pH ( histamine_H2-receptor_antagonists such as ranitidine or <e10> triazolam </e10> ) may reduce plasma concentrations of <e20> Acarbose </e20> and therefore potentially may adversely affect glycemic control.
mechanism	The maximum plasma concentration of <e10> enoxacin </e10> is decreased by the concomitant administration of <e20> diflunisal </e20>, and the maximal plasma concentration of enoxacin may be decreased by the concomitant administration of ketoconazole or nonstero-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_agents.
mechanism	<e10> Acetazolamide </e10> may increase plasma <e20> salicylate </e20> concentration and may reduce its renal clearance.

mechanism	<e11> SUSTIVA </e11> may delay or reduce the normal renal clearance of some antihypertensives ( aliskiren, nisoldipine, atorvastatin, <e20> efavirenz </e20>, fluconazole, indinavir, midazolam, rifabutin, sildenafil, theophylline (intravenous and oral), triazol
mechanism	Plasma concentrations of <e11> EQUETROTM </e11> are reduced when given with other drugs that increase or inhibit the cytochrome P450 system (e,g,, ketoconazole, macrolide_antibiotics such as <e20> erythromycin </e20> ).
mechanism	Concurrent administration of <e10> cisapride </e10> and <e20> dofetilide </e20> (1 mg/kg, s,c,) resulted in a reduction of dofetilide clearance by 21% on average.
mechanism	Administration of <e10> diltiazem </e10> with oral anticoagulants that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 (eg, warfarin, phenytoin, propranolol, or diltiazem ) may result in increased plasma levels of <e20> cyclosporine </e20>.

mechanism	<e10> Naproxen </e10>, naproxen_sodium and other naproxen-type products may increase plasma <e20> methotrexate </e20> concentrations.
mechanism	The effects of other <e12> quinolones </e12> ( ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, and troleandomycin ) on plasma concentrations of <e20> didanosine </e20> are unknown, but decreased exposure to didanosine by these agents should be considered.
mechanism	Elevated plasma concentrations of <e10> lansoprazole </e10> have been reported during concomitant administration of <e20> omeprazole </e20> capsules and erythromycin, resulting in elevated plasma concentrations of lansoprazole and increased gastrointestinal symptoms.
mechanism	Elevated serum levels of theophylline have been reported during concomitant administration of <e10> cobalt </e10> with some antacids containing magnesium or aluminum, but not with sucralfate, because the two metal cations interfere with the metabolism of <e20> theophylline </e20>.

mechanism	Therefore, when <e10> warfarin </e10> and <e20> phenytoin </e20> are used concurrently, the expected decrease in plasma renin activity may be greater than the decrease seen with warfarin alone.
mechanism	However, when <e10> eplerenone </e10> was given concurrently with phenytoin, the serum concentration of <e20> phenytoin </e20> increased significantly (p less than #).
mechanism	Drugs such as <e10> phenytoin </e10>, rifampin, and barbiturates may increase plasma <e20> Clozapine </e20> concentrations due to the induction of CYP3A.

mechanism	<e10> Acetazolamide </e10> may also raise serum <e20> cyclosporine </e20> levels.
mechanism	When administered with <e10> warfarin </e10> or its derivatives, <e20> saquinavir </e20> significantly decreases the plasma concentrations of both the active and conserved isomer of saquinavir, thereby substantially reducing its therapeutic effect.

mechanism	The mechanism of interaction between <e10> terfenadine </e10> and <e20> atorvastatin </e20> is not fully understood, but it may be that terfenadine may inhibit the metabolism of atorvastatin leading to increased serum concentrations of atorvastatin.
mechanism	When <e10> fluvoxamine </e10> was administered concomitantly with <e20> phenytoin </e20> in normal volunteers, a slight reduction in serum concentration of fluvoxamine was seen, probably due to a minor metabolism modification.
mechanism	Cholestyramine : <e10> Cholestyramine </e10> is known to reduce intestinal absorption of some <e22> fat-soluble_vitamins </e22>, resulting in low plasma concentrations.
mechanism	Because <e10> diflunisal </e10> may alter gastrointestinal absorption of <e20> ertapenem </e20>, a possible decrease in efficacy may result.

mechanism	Methotrexate : Increased serum levels of <e10> methotrexate </e10> may occur when patients take <e20> minocycline </e20>, a potent inhibitor of methotrexate metabolism.
mechanism	<e11> SPRYCEL </e11>, by reducing the plasma concentration of <e20> ethinyl_estradiol </e20>, may also increase the risk of developing progestins that induce an estrogen receptor-mediated inhibition of the cytochrome P450 system.
mechanism	The plasma concentration of <e10> azithromycin </e10> may be increased when it is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e,g,, cimetidine, fluoxetine ) and decreased by hepatic enzyme inducers (e,g,, barbiturates, phenytoin ), and adjustment of the dosage of <e20> azithromycin </e20> may therefore be necessary.
mechanism	Plasma concentrations of most <e12> quinolones </e12> are increased when administered with antacids containing magnesium, calcium, or <e20> aluminum </e20>.
mechanism	<e10> Erythromycin </e10> inhibits the metabolism of warfarin and its derivatives, and it has been reported that <e20> theophylline </e20> may increase the plasma level of warfarin and its derivatives.
mechanism	This has been demonstrated by the induction of CYP3A4 activity in the presence of <e10> quinidine </e10> and its metabolism in the presence of <e20> omeprazole </e20>.
mechanism	<e10> Chlorprothixene </e10> has been shown to interfere with the metabolism of <e20> caffeine </e20>.
mechanism	<e11> Norpace </e11> # mg administered once daily for # days decreased the AUC of <e20> midazolam </e20> by 38% and decreased the AUC of triazolam by 39%.
mechanism	Concurrent administration of <e11> Lodine </e11> with <e20> calcium_blockers </e20> and with other multivalent cations such as magnesium, aluminum, or iron may significantly decrease serum concentrations of calcium, causing increased risk of bone and dental damage.
mechanism	The mechanism by which <e10> diltiazem </e10> increases plasma concentrations of <e20> S-warfarin </e20> is not known, but may be related to a blocking effect on the hepatic metabolism of warfarin.
mechanism	<e10> Grepafloxacin </e10> may interact with the metabolism or renal tubular secretion of several drugs, including acetaminophen, calcium_channel_blockers, dapsone, disopyramide, quinine, warfarin, certain <e22> tricyclic_antidepressants </e22>, and theophylline (intravenous and oral).
mechanism	Plasma concentrations of imipramine, desipramine, and <e10> fluoxetine </e10> have been reported to be increased when coadministered with the CYP2D6 substrate <e20> triazolam </e20>.
mechanism	Co-administration of <e10> fluoxetine </e10> had a modest effect on the plasma concentrations of <e20> theophylline </e20>.
mechanism	Because <e10> lansoprazole </e10> inhibits the metabolism of <e20> cyclosporine </e20>, it is theoretically possible that high doses of lansoprazole may produce a decrease in serum cyclosporine levels.
mechanism	Aspirin : In vitro data indicate that <e10> diclofenac </e10> significantly inhibits the metabolism of <e20> aspirin </e20> resulting in a 60% increase in plasma exposure and a 90% decrease in bioavailability.
mechanism	<e10> Naproxen </e10> reduces <e20> caffeine </e20> gastrointestinal absorption and increases the rate of elimination.
mechanism	Elevated plasma concentrations of some <e12> quinolones </e12> have been reported with concomitant use of compounds that inhibit CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifabutin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, <e20> nelfinavir </e20>, saquinavir
mechanism	Concurrent administration of <e10> atorvastatin </e10> and <e20> indinavir </e20> produced a 34% increase in indinavir plasma AUC and a 28% increase in atorvastatin plasma A,C.
mechanism	Co-administration with oral doses of <e10> chloroquine </e10> or related <e22> quinolones </e22> had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole, suggesting that the systemic clearance of fluconazole may be increased by these co-administration modalities.
mechanism	Coadministration of <e10> warfarin </e10> and <e20> gabapentin </e20> increased gabapentin plasma concentrations approximately 3-fold.
mechanism	<e10> Isoniazid </e10> : May decrease the clearance of <e20> ketoconazole </e20>, resulting in elevated plasma concentrations of the latter.
mechanism	In the presence of <e10> enoxacin </e10> at # mg QID (4 x # mg/mL), the fluconazole AUC increased approximately 30% and the <e20> enoxacin </e20> Cmin increased approximately 30% relative to that seen in patients not treated with fluconazole.
mechanism	The oral anticoagulants, <e10> phenytoin </e10>, propranolol, or rifampin may inhibit the metabolism of <e20> warfarin </e20> and therefore decrease plasma concentrations.
int	Since <e10> cypermethrin </e10> is a strong oxidant and is rarely found in normal biological fluids, caution should be exercised when any drug affecting human metabolism is administered concomitantly with <e20> cypermethrin </e20>.
