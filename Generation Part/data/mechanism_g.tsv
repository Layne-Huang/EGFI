mechanism	Because it has not been investigated as a thyroid_lowering agent (e,g,, <e12> albino-hydrochloride </e12>, thyroid_lowering_agents ), <e20> carbamazepine </e20> may not be tolerated by patients taking <e22> albino-hydrochloride </e22>. 
mechanism	Antacids : No treatment for <e10> antacids </e10>, either in plasma or in urine, has been demonstrated to prevent their absorption or sensitization in patients receiving <e20> antacids </e20>, and did not occur with #2 (rhodamine ), #3 (methoxamine ), #4 (methoxybenzoquinone ), #5 (dihydrochlorothiazide ), #6 (

mechanism	The following is a list of possible pharmacologic interactions between <e10> NSAIDs </e10> and <e20> digoxin </e20>. 
mechanism	Antacids : <e10> Phenobarbital </e10>, <e20> quinidine </e20>, and beta-blockers, as well as antidepressants (e,g,, tetracyclines, ampicillin, phenytoin, prednisolone ), are known to decrease the bioavailability of CYP3A4_inhibitors, as did quinidine. 
mechanism	Drugs other than theophylline that interact with theophylline or theophylline_beta-hydroxide and <e10> phenytoin </e10> (e,g,, fluoxetine, isoniazid, naproxen ) have been associated with changes in plasma concentrations and toxicity.

mechanism	Propranolol <e12> <e20> antihypertensive_drug </e20> </e20> and <e22> amiodarone </e22> may interfere with the metabolism of a clinically important metabolite of choline. 
mechanism	The administration of <e12> benzodiazepines </e12> with benzodiazepines such as valproic acid, <e20> indinavir </e20>, phenytoin, and warfarin has been associated with decreased CNS inhibition and CNS conduction inhibition resulting in a clinically significant decrease in the half-life of <e21> benzodiazepines </e21>. 
mechanism	 CYP3A4 : <e10> Coadministration of CYP3A4 in the presence of <e20> digoxin </e20> with digoxin and <e22> digoxin-based contraceptives, where digoxin is <e22> a digoxin-based contraceptive </e22>, may result in increased oral contraceptive doses. 
mechanism	There is little information available about the extent to which <e12> phenothiazines </e12> may interact with phenothiazines (e,g,, <e20> benzodiazepines </e20> ), and the extent to which phenothiazines interact with <e20> sedative_antidepressants </e20>. 
mechanism	<e10> Ethanol </e10> is given on doses of <e20> phenobarbital </e20> and other CNS_depressants, which result in reduced plasma levels of both phenobarbital and phenobarbital. 
mechanism	Antacids, <e12> Tetracyclines </e12>, <e20> <e21> Benzodiazepines </e21>, Benzodiazepines, phenytoin, fluoxetine, and phenytoin may affect CNS absorption. 
mechanism	<e10> Inhalation of <e22> <e23> sodiumbenzylhydrate </e22> in rats resulted in a significant reduction in serum concentrations of the aminoglycosides sulfonylureanide and niacinamide, and decreased the secretion of <e22> anticonvulsants </e22>. 
mechanism	The coadministration of <e10> d-myroxine </e10> with any other anticonvulsants other than these, including the <e20> azithromycin </e20> and <e21> fluoxetine </e21>, has not been studied, although an ongoing study is necessary to evaluate the effects of the dihydrochloride-containing formulations on the clinical reactions of these individuals. 
mechanism	At least one study with <e10> phenytoin </e10> has shown a clinically significant increase in mean plasma <e20> phenytoin </e20> concentrations following oral administration of <e22> methotrexate </e22>.

mechanism	Cholestyramine ( <e12> cholestyramine </e12> ) is a potent inhibitor of plasma concentrations of <e20> phenytoin </e20>. 
mechanism	A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of erythromycin and a pharmacokinetic study of <e10> rifampin </e10> with a known additive of <e20> methyldopa </e20> was conducted in two adults (1 male and 1 female) receiving the <e20> methyldopa </e20> or azithromycin. 
mechanism	<e10> Furosemide </e10> increases the plasma concentrations of #3 inducers of calcium, <e20> potassium </e20>, and calcium_chloride. 
mechanism	<e10> cimetidine </e10> can potentiate the action of cyclosporine on anticholinergic receptors (eg, <e20> warfarin </e20> ), such that potentiating these anticholinergic effects may result in anticholinergic reactions to CNS depressants like alcohol. 
mechanism	 <e10> Atropine </e10> and <e20> Phenobarbital </e20> have been reported to decrease the absorption of <e20> fluoxetine </e20> and carbamazepine.

mechanism	The concomitant administration of <e10> bacitracin </e10> and carbamazepine may increase the risk of severe CNS depression (eg, amiodarone, acetaminophen ), hypotension (eg, alprazolam ), renal failure (eg, <e20> metoprolol </e20> ), hypotension, renal failure (eg, metoprolol ), and potassium loss. 
mechanism	Antacid : In vitro studies suggest that, when <e10> coadministration of <e20> indinavir </e20> with NSAIDs or <e22> thiazide </e22> (e,g,, # mg for # days), <e20> NSAIDs </e20> may increase the pharmacokinetics of thyroid hormone, which may enhance the pharmacokinetics of antihistamines.

mechanism	Since acetaminophen has no adverse effects on the plasma levels of <e10> amiodarone </e10>, <e20> phenytoin </e20>, and ketoconazole, acetaminophen should not be taken at any time prior to initiation of <e22> coadministration of either <e22> carbamazepine </e22> or cimetidine </e22>.

mechanism	N-acetyl-Hexamine_inhibitors such as <e10> acetaminophen </e10> (Cimetidine ) and concomitant administration of quinidine may increase the clearance of drugs such as <e20> phenobarbital </e20> and quinidine, thereby increasing the chance of adverse events. 
mechanism	<e10> Carbamazepine </e10> : Preliminary evidence suggests that a concomitant use of <e22> phenytoin </e22> or the other drugs phenytoin and <e22> phenytoin_benzodiazepines </e22>, may cause severe CNS depressant effects. 
mechanism	Acids : <e10> Phenothiazines </e10> (fluoxetine, phenytoin, phenytoin_sodium ) and other <e20> anticonvulsants </e20> are known to decrease serum levels of diazepam. 
mechanism	The inhibitory effect of <e10> phenytoin </e10> and <e20> prednisolone </e20> on dopamine (dopa) metabolism is controlled by the following: <e20> antihypertensive_drugs </e20>, anticonvulsants, and benzodiazepines. 
mechanism	The most potent therapy for <e10> antihypertensive_agents </e10> and <e20> tranquilizers </e20>, CYP3A4, cyclosporine, and thiazides, should be administered with caution when used with concomitant therapy with # or <e22> lithium </e22>. 
mechanism	The administration of <e10> sertraline </e10> in combination with <e22> sertraline </e22> may increase the adverse effects of these drugs.

mechanism	<e10> Citalopram </e10> reduces the elimination of oral <e22> anticonvulsants </e22> and increases the half-life of oral anticonvulsants by approximately 15 minutes (10-20%) and 15 minutes (20-45%) respectively (21,22). 
mechanism	Drug Interactions: <e10> CYP3A4 </e10> -preparation of <e20> aminoglycosides </e20> resulted in increased serum plasma concentrations of these drugs. 
mechanism	Concomitant use of <e12> morphine </e12> and <e22> dihydrochloride </e22> should be stopped for patients receiving concomitant use of either of these drugs. 
mechanism	The following drugs may decrease the elimination of CYP3A4 (e,g,, <e10> ketoconazole </e10>, anticonvulsants, warfarin, <e22> anticonvulsants </e22>, and some antidiabetic_drugs ): methotrexate, warfarin, phenytoin, salicylic_acid_inhibitors, fluoxetine, <e20> methot
mechanism	<e10> SSRIs </e10> : <e20> clonidine </e20>, concomitant administration of aspirin, concomitant administration of a <e21> potassium </e21>, or anhydride, may increase the plasma concentrations of <e22> SSRIs </e22>. 
mechanism	<e10> Agapeptide </e10> and its metabolites, like ketoconazole and cimetidine, are highly potent antagonists of methotrexate, thus, concomitantly, concomitant administration of <e22> anticonvulsants </e22> and anticonvulsants with Agapeptide can reduce their pharmacokinetic action by over 30%. 
mechanism	The plasma concentrations of <e12> dexamethasone </e12> and <e20> methyldopa </e20> are not affected by concurrent administration of <e22> dexamethasone </e22> or the use of phenytoin. 
mechanism	In a study, d_nephenone, <e10> phenytoin </e10>, <e20> <e20> terfenadine </e20>, or <e22> acetaminophen_antagonists </e22> were used to modify and thereby reduce <e22> d_nephenone </e22> action.

mechanism	Etonogestrel Injections of <e10> Etonogestrel </e10>, <e20> cyclosporine </e20>, methotrexate, or other benzodiazepines may potentiate the sedation-induced hypoglycemia effects of <e22> phenytoin </e22>. 
mechanism	<e12> Fentanyl </e12> (piperazine) was not effective against the oral route of cephalosporine_2, but the pharmacokinetics of furosemide, phenytoin, and tetracycline were substantially increased. 
mechanism	In a clinical trial with erythromycin and amiodarone, patients receiving the latter were not required to <e10> erythromycin </e10> concomitantly. 
mechanism	Concomitant administration of <e10> benzodiazepines </e10> and <e22> phenytoin </e22>, with <e23> cyclosporine </e23> or a combination of those two drugs, may reduce the pharmacokinetics and/or potentiate the potentiation of benzodiazepines. 
mechanism	The use of <e10> aspirin </e10> in conjunction with nonsteroidal_anti-inflammatory_agents is recommended. 
mechanism	 The presence of <e10> cimetidine </e10> may increase the effects of <e20> salicylic_acid </e20>, thus decreasing the dose of dizantile and the dose of estrogens. 
mechanism	It has been shown that <e10> dihydrosuropyridine </e10> may reduce its bioavailability.

mechanism	Preliminary clinical evidence suggests that coadministration of <e10> anticonvulsants </e10> with <e22> naproxen </e22> should be avoided during pregnancy or during first trimester. 
mechanism	<e12> Antihistamines </e12> -like drugs that can cause hyperlipidemia and/or hypoglycemia, may potentiate the metabolism of methotrexate, ketoconazole, and concomitant medications containing ethinyl_estradiol, or are of similar class to methotrexate.

mechanism	In animal studies, <e10> phenothiazines </e10> were administered concurrently with <e20> clonidine </e20> and/or succinylcholine. 
mechanism	It is possible that <e10> oral <e20> coadministration </e20> with <e22> anesthetics </e22> may increase <e20> CNS permeability to benzodiazepines and/or similar substances.

mechanism	CNS interaction with <e10> corticosteroids </e10> may increase the CNS excitability of those with elevated CNS concentrations of <e20> corticosteroids </e20> and, in the latter case, may potentiate the CNS release of certain drugs. 
mechanism	 The potential toxicity of a <e10> tricyclic_antidepressants </e10> in the management of neuropsychiatric disorders should be considered with caution. 
mechanism	In two clinical studies, bicarbonate and oral anticoagulants were administered concurrently, concomitantly, <e10> oral anticoagulants </e10> and <e20> diclofenac </e20>. 
mechanism	Interactions between <e10> anticholinergic_agents </e10> and <e20> methotrexate </e20> may occur. 
mechanism	Although <e10> anticholinergic_agents </e10> may be beneficial, their effectiveness and general concomitant effects should be evaluated carefully when pharmacokinetic studies are initiated in patients with multiple sclerosis ( MS ).

mechanism	Although patients who have <e10> ketoconazole </e10> and <e20> phenytoin </e20> have reported an elevated ketoconazole concentration, pharmacokinetic studies indicate that the ketoconazole metabolite of <e22> erythromycin </e22> is unaffected by the drug's ketoconazole component. 
mechanism	Concomitant administration of <e12> ketoconazole </e12> with <e20> indinavir </e20> in patients with congestive heart failure or with a combination of concomitant use of metformin and nelfinavir has not been concomitantly associated with decreased blood levels of concomitant metformin.

mechanism	In the clinical setting of patients receiving <e10> monoamine_oxidase_inhibitors </e10> or CYP3A4 inhibitors, <e20> dexamethasone </e20> should be used, since other antipsychotics that enhance the safety profile of clonidine may potentiate the interaction of clonidine with a pharmacologic effect. 
mechanism	<e10> Tegretol </e10> is a potent anticonvulsant, diuretics and <e20> rifampin </e20>. 
mechanism	<e12> Fructose </e12> -like potentiating agents (e,g,, glucose_lactate, phenytoin, phenytoin-containing glycerol, <e20> corticosteroids </e20>, warfarin, or glyburide ) may increase the absorption of digoxin, which increases its toxicity.
