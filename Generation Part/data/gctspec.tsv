mechanism	(1968, 1970), the <e10> phenytoin </e10> (100 mg BID for # days) increased the AUC of <e20> warfarin </e20> by 25%, and the AUC of phenytoin (50 mg BID for # days) by 18%.
mechanism	This might be because <e10> phenytoin </e10> increases the serum concentration of <e20> vitamin_D </e20>.
mechanism	An intravenous injection of <e10> diclofenac </e10> with <e20> lithium </e20> or other diuretics increases lithium plasma concentrations.
mechanism	<e10> Amiodarone </e10> decreased the plasma levels of <e20> verapamil </e20> and its active metabolite.
