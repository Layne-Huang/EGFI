effect	These behavioural observations were consistent with in vivo positron emission tomography dopamine transporter imaging data, and with post-mortem stereological counts of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, as well as striatal intensity measurements of dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, which were all significantly higher in <e13> 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine </e13> / <e23> 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)_ethynyl]_pyridine </e23> -treated animals than in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine /vehicle-treated monkeys.
effect	The <e13> 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)_ethynyl]_pyridine </e13> treatment also had a significant effect on the <e23> 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine </e23> -induced loss of norepinephrine neurons in the locus coeruleus and adjoining A5 and A7 noradrenaline cell groups.
effect	In 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine /vehicle-treated animals, almost 40% loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive norepinephrine neurons was found in locus coeruleus/A5/A7 noradrenaline cell groups, whereas the extent of neuronal loss was lower than 15% of control values in <e13> 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine </e13> / <e23> 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)_ethynyl]_pyridine </e23> -treated monkeys.
effect	Our data demonstrate that chronic treatment with the metabotropic glutamate receptor # antagonist, <e13> 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)_ethynyl]_pyridine </e13> , significantly reduces <e23> 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine </e23> toxicity towards dopaminergic and noradrenergic cell groups in non-human primates.

effect	In female rats, neonatal <e13> quinpirole </e13> treatment enhanced <e20> amphetamine </e20> locomotor sensitization compared with quinpirole -free controls sensitized to amphetamine .
effect	Reduction of PTH by <e10> cinacalcet </e10> is associated with a decrease in <e20> darbepoetin </e20> requirement.
effect	Interaction of <e10> celecoxib </e10> with different <e22> anti-cancer_drugs </e22> is antagonistic in breast but not in other cancer cells.
effect	We found antagonism between celecoxib and the four drugs in the breast cancer cells MCF7 following all incubation schedules and between <e10> celecoxib </e10> and <e20> doxorubicin </e20> in all cell lines except for two combinations in HCT116 cells.
effect	The combination of <e10> minocycline </e10> and <e20> fosfomycin </e20> can be synergistic against MRSA.
effect	Although single or concurrent use of <e10> sunitinib </e10> and <e20> docetaxel </e20> has some anti-proliferative effects, the sequential administrations of both drugs remarkably enhanced anti-tumor activity.
effect	When cells were exposed to <e10> docetaxel </e10> followed by <e20> sunitinib </e20> , synergism was observed.
effect	The molecular basis of this synergism is that the signaling pathways that were initially activated by <e10> docetaxel </e10> exposure were efficiently suppressed by the subsequent exposure to <e20> sunitinib </e20> .
effect	Sunitinib as a single agent exhibits anti-proliferative effects in vitro in NSCLC cell lines with EGFR T790M and K-ras mutations but the sequential administration of <e10> docetaxel </e10> followed by <e20> sunitinib </e20> is superior to sunitinib followed by docetaxel and concurrent administration.

effect	HEY cells treated with <e10> dasatinib </e10> plus <e20> paclitaxel </e20> formed fewer colonies than did cells treated with either agent alone.
effect	Treatment of HEY xenograft-bearing mice with <e10> dasatinib </e10> plus <e20> paclitaxel </e20> inhibited tumor growth more than treatment with either agent alone (average tumor volume per mouse, dasatinib + paclitaxel vs paclitaxel : # vs, # cm3, difference = # cm3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = # to # cm3, P = #);
effect	Studies with forced expression and siRNA knockdown of Bcl-2 and Cdk1 suggest that <e10> dasatinib </e10> -mediated induction of p27(Kip1) enhanced <e20> paclitaxel </e20> -induced apoptosis by negatively regulating Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression.
effect	Inhibition of Src family and Abl kinases with either siRNAs or <e10> dasatinib </e10> enhances <e20> paclitaxel </e20> sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells through p27(Kip1)-mediated suppression of Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression.
effect	The preclinical combination of <e10> lenalidomide </e10> with the mTOR inhibitor <e20> CCI-779 </e20> has displayed synergy in vitro and represents a novel combination in MM.

effect	<e10> Lapatinib </e10> enhances <e21> herceptin </e21> -mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by up-regulation of cell surface HER2 expression.
effect	Although it was previously reported that <e10> lapatinib </e10> combined with <e21> Herceptin </e21> improved the progression-free survival rate compared with lapatinib alone for patients with Herceptin -refractory HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, the mechanism is purported to be an antiproliferative effect relating to the synergism of these two agents.
effect	In an in vitro assay, <e10> lapatinib </e10> induced HER2 expression at the cell surface of HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines, leading to the enhancement of <e21> Herceptin </e21> -mediated ADCC.
effect	Furthermore, we present a case report in which a second <e11> Herceptin </e11> treatment following <e20> lapatinib </e20> resulted in the marked shrinkage of multiple metastatic tumors in HER2-positive breast cancer.
effect	CRM197 induced apoptosis, and furthermore, the combination of <e13> CRM197 </e13> plus <e20> doxorubicin </e20> enhanced cytotoxicity in a T-ALL cell line.
effect	<e10> Ephedrine </e10> enhances the antinociceptive effect of <e20> dexmedetomidine </e20> in mice.
effect	In the hot plate test in mice, co-administration of # g/kg <e10> dexmedetomidine </e10> with # mg/kg <e20> ephedrine </e20> intraperitoneally not only enhanced, but also prolonged the duration of antinociception induced by dexmedetomidine .
effect	At the same time, the locomotor inhibitory effect of <e10> dexmedetomidine </e10> was counteracted by <e20> ephedrine </e20> .
effect	We concluded that the combined administration of <e10> dexmedetomidine </e10> with <e20> ephedrine </e20> may have beneficial effects in the treatment of pain without causing sedation, which limits the use of dexmedetomidine as an analgesic in humans.
effect	The FDA has approved <e10> ticagrelor </e10> ( Brilinta -AstraZeneca), an oral antiplatelet_drug , for use with low-dose <e21> aspirin </e21> to reduce the rate of thrombotic cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
