negative	Uricosuric_Agents : Since the excretion of <e1> oxipurinol </e1> is similar to that of urate, <e2> uricosuric_agents </e2> , which increase the excretion of urate, are also likely to increase the excretion of oxipurinol and thus lower the degree of inhibition of xanthine oxidase.

effect	Fulminant rhabdomyolysis has been seen as early as three weeks after initiation of combined therapy with another <e1> fibrate </e1> and <e2> lovastatin </e2> but may be seen after several months.
effect	For these reasons, it is felt that, in most subjects who have had an unsatisfactory lipid response to either drug alone, the possible benefits of combined therapy with <e1> lovastatin </e1> and a <e2> fibrate </e2> do not outweigh the risks of severe myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure.

negative	Concomitant use of agents in the <e1> tricyclic_antidepressant_class </e1> (which includes Anafranil ) with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the <e2> tricyclic_antidepressant_agent </e2> or the other drug.

negative	There was no significant difference in the pharmacodynamic effect of <e1> warfarin </e1> administered alone and warfarin administered with <e2> Lodine </e2> as measured by prothrombin time.
negative	There was no significant difference in the pharmacodynamic effect of warfarin administered alone and <e1> warfarin </e1> administered with <e2> Lodine </e2> as measured by prothrombin time.
negative	Thus, concomitant therapy with <e1> warfarin </e1> and <e2> Lodine </e2> should not require dosage adjustment of either drug.
effect	However, caution should be exercised because there have been a few spontaneous reports of prolonged prothrombin times, with or without bleeding, in <e1> etodolac </e1> -treated patients receiving concomitant <e2> warfarin </e2> therapy.
negative	Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions The urine of patients who take <e1> Lodine </e1> can give a false-positive reaction for urinary bilirubin (urobilin) due to the presence of phenolic metabolites of <e2> etodolac </e2> .

mechanism	Cimetidine : In the presence of <e1> cimetidine </e1> at # mg QID (N=12) the mean apparent oral clearance of <e2> gabapentin </e2> fell by 14% and creatinine clearance fell by 10%.
mechanism	Thus <e1> cimetidine </e1> appeared to alter the renal excretion of both <e2> gabapentin </e2> and creatinine, an endogenous marker of renal function.
mechanism	This small decrease in excretion of <e1> gabapentin </e1> by <e2> cimetidine </e2> is not expected to be of clinical importance.
negative	The effect of <e1> gabapentin </e1> on <e2> cimetidine </e2> was not evaluated.

mechanism	The Cmax of <e1> norethindrone </e1> was 13% higher when it was coadministered with <e2> gabapentin </e2> ;
mechanism	Antacid ( Maalox ): <e1> Maalox </e1> reduced the bioavailability of <e2> gabapentin </e2> (N=16) by about 20%.
mechanism	This decrease in bioavailability was about 5% when <e1> gabapentin </e1> was administered # hours after <e2> Maalox </e2> .
advise	It is recommended that <e1> gabapentin </e1> be taken at least # hours following <e2> Maalox </e2> administration.
negative	<e1> Gabapentin </e1> pharmacokinetic parameters without and with <e2> probenecid </e2> were comparable.
negative	This indicates that <e1> gabapentin </e1> does not undergo renal tubular secretion by the pathway that is blocked by <e2> probenecid </e2> .
negative	Drug/Laboratory Tests Interactions Because false positive readings were reported with the Ames N-Multistix SG dipstick test for urinary protein when <e1> gabapentin </e1> was added to other <e2> antiepileptic_drugs </e2> , the more specific sulfosalicylic acid precipitation procedure is recommended to determine the presence of urine protein
negative	In patients receiving a potent CYP3A4 inducer such as <e1> rifampicin </e1> or <e2> phenytoin </e2> , a dose increase to # mg daily should be considered in the absence of severe adverse drug reaction, and clinical response and adverse events should be carefully monitored (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY-Pharmacokinetics-Drug-Drug Interactions and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION-Dosage Adjustment sections).
