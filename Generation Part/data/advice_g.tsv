advice	There is a risk that <e10> aspirin </e10> may increase the effect of <e20> calcium </e20> and vitamin_B12. 
advice	Other medications may decrease the blood-sugar and muscle-thinner response to <e10> lithium </e10>. 
advice	<e10> Ciprofloxacin </e10> may be helpful in reducing or preventing the hypotensive effects of narcotics such as alcohol, heroin, <e22> caffeine </e22>, and other <e20> narcotic_derivatives </e20>.

advice	Administration of co-administered oral <e10> cimetidine </e10> with oral <e20> tricyclic_antidepressants </e20> should not be recommended when concomitant administration with co-administered fluoxetine with <e20> levodopa </e20> is not needed. 
advice	In patients with clinical history of CVD and other known alcohol-dependent events, concomitant administration of <e11> alcohol_relaxant </e11> with <e22> amiodarone </e22> may increase the risk of CNS-depressant-induced CNS depressant reactions. 
advice	<e10> Ampicillin </e10> may increase the absorption of <e20> vitamin_2 </e20>, which may decrease the effectiveness of probenecid and others antihistamines, warfarin, and phenytoin.

advice	If your doctor prescribes a therapy to treat depression, alcohol or drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (such as <e10> carbamazepine </e10> ), discontinue that therapy. 
advice	Avoiding the possible formation of reactive oxygen species (redox reactions), which may result in premature initiation of <e11> NIRACEPO </e11>, may increase the risk of concomitant concomitant use of <e20> nitrous oxide </e20>. 
advice	Because <e10> Coadministration of oral contraceptives with <e22> corticosteroids </e22> may result in the addition of multiple <e20> levodopa </e20> products, these medications should be avoided concurrently with <e22> corticosteroids </e22>.
