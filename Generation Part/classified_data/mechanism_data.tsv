mechanism	Promethazine : Coadministration of a single dose of <e10> zaleplon </e10> and <e20> promethazine </e20> (10 and # mg, respectively) resulted in a 15% decrease in maximal plasma concentrations of zaleplon , but no change in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve.
mechanism	Multiple-dose administration of the potent CYP3A4 inducer <e10> rifampin </e10> (600 mg every # hours, q24h, for # days), however, reduced <e20> zaleplon </e20> Cmax and AUC by approximately 80%.
