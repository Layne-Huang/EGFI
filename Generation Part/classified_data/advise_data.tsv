advise	Aspirin : Concomitant administration of <e10> diclofenac </e10> and <e21> aspirin </e21> is not recommended because diclofenac is displaced from its binding sites during the concomitant administration of aspirin , resulting in lower plasma concentrations, peak plasma levels, and AUC values.
advise	Anticoagulants : While studies have not shown <e10> diclofenac </e10> to interact with anticoagulants_of_the_warfarin_type , caution should be exercised, nonetheless, since interactions have been seen with other <e22> NSAIDs </e22> .
advise	Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis, and NSAIDs affect platelet function as well, concurrent therapy with all <e12> NSAIDs </e12> , including diclofenac , and <e20> warfarin </e20> requires close monitoring of patients to be certain that no change in their anticoagulant dosage is required.

advise	Patients currently receiving <e10> diltiazem </e10> therapy should be carefully monitored for a change in pharmacological effect when initiating and discontinuing therapy with <e20> cimetidine </e20> .
advise	Since there have been conflicting results regarding the effect of digoxin levels, it is recommended that <e10> digoxin </e10> levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing <e20> diltiazem_hydrochloride </e20> therapy to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization.
advise	When used concomitantly, <e12> anesthetics </e12> and <e22> calcium_channel_blockers </e22> should be titrated carefully.

advise	<e10> DISULFIRAM </e10> SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION IN THOSE PATIENTS REVEIVING <e20> PHENYTOIN </e20> AND ITS CONGENERS.
advise	It may be necessary to adjust the dosage of oral <e12> anticoagulants </e12> upon beginning or stopping <e20> disulfiram </e20> , since disulfiram may prolong prothrombin time.
advise	Patients taking <e10> isoniazid </e10> when <e20> disulfiram </e20> is given should be observed for the appearance of unsteady gait or marked changes in mental status;
advise	If a patient requires <e11> TIKOSYN </e11> and anti-ulcer therapy, it is suggested that omeprazole , ranitidine , or antacids ( aluminum_hydroxide and magnesium_hydroxide ) be used as alternatives to <e20> cimetidine </e20> , as these agents have no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of TIKOSYN .
advise	In addition, drugs that are actively secreted via this route (e,g,, <e10> triamterene </e10> , metformin and amiloride ) should be co-administered with care as they might increase <e20> dofetilide </e20> levels.

advise	Concurrent use of <e10> flurbiprofen </e10> and <e21> aspirin </e21> is therefore not recommended.
advise	Patients taking both <e10> flurbiprofen </e10> and a <e22> beta-blocker </e22> should be monitored to ensure that a satisfactory hypotensive effect is achieved.
advise	Therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary when <e11> EULEXIN </e11> Capsules are administered concomitantly with <e20> warfarin </e20> .

advise	This interaction, which has not been investigated using higher doses of fluvoxamine , may be more pronounced if a # mg daily dose is co-administered, particularly since fluvoxamine exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100-300 mg, If <e10> alprazolam </e10> is co-administered with <e20> Fluvoxamine </e20> Tablets, the initial alprazolam dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended.
advise	Diazepam : The co-administration of <e10> Fluvoxamine </e10> Tablets and <e20> diazepam </e20> is generally not advisable.
advise	Evidence supporting the conclusion that it is inadvisable to co-administer <e10> fluvoxamine </e10> and <e20> diazepam </e20> is derived from a study in which healthy volunteers taking # mg/day of fluvoxamine were administered a single oral dose of # mg of diazepam .
advise	Accordingly, <e10> diazepam </e10> and <e20> fluvoxamine </e20> should not ordinarily be co-administered.
advise	Therefore, if <e10> theophylline </e10> is co-administered with <e20> fluvoxamine_maleate </e20> , its dose should be reduced to one third of the usual daily maintenance dose and plasma concentrations of theophylline should to monitored.

advise	Therefore, concurrent use of <e11> aspirin </e11> and <e20> ketoprofen </e20> is not recommended.
advise	Because prostaglandina play an important role in hemostasis and ketoprofen has an effect on platelet function as well, concurent therapy with <e10> ketoprofen </e10> and <e20> warfarin </e20> requires close monitoring of patients on both drugs.
advise	Therefore, the combination of <e10> ketoprofen </e10> and <e20> probenecid </e20> is not recommended.
advise	It is recommended that plasma lithium levels be monitored when <e10> ketoprofen </e10> is coadministered with <e20> lithium </e20> .
advise	Although these results do not indicate a significant interaction between TORADOL and warfarin or heparin , the administration of <e11> TORADOL </e11> to patients taking <e22> anticoagulants </e22> should be done extremely cautiously, and patients should be closely monitored.
advise	Therefore, concomitant use of <e11> TORADOL </e11> and <e20> probenecid </e20> is contraindicated.
advise	Care should be taken if <e10> labetalol </e10> is used concomitantly with <e22> calcium_antagonist </e22> s of the verapamil type.

advise	Nonetheless, individual patients may require additional titration of their <e10> theophylline </e10> dosage when <e20> lansoprazole </e20> is started or stopped to ensure clinically effective blood levels.
advise	Therefore, <e12> proton_pump_inhibitors </e12> should be taken at least # minutes prior to <e20> sucralfate </e20> .
advise	Because of the potential for ARAVA levels to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both <e11> ARAVA </e11> and <e20> rifampin </e20> .
advise	Because of reports of prolongation of the prothrombin time beyond the therapeutic range in patients taking concurrent <e10> levamisole </e10> and <e20> warfarin_sodium </e20> , it is suggested that the prothrombin time be monitored carefully, and the dose of warfarin_sodium or other coumarin -like drugs should be adjusted accordingly, in patients taking both drugs.

advise	Anticoagulant therapy should be monitored, particularly during the first few weeks, after initiating therapy with <e11> BEXTRA </e11> in patients receiving <e20> warfarin </e20> or similar agents.
advise	Because changes in glucose concentrations with valdecoxib coadministration were within the normal variability and individual glucose concentrations were above or near # mg/dL, dose adjustment for <e10> glyburide </e10> (5 mg QD and # mg BID) with <e20> valdecoxib </e20> coadministration (up to # mg QD) is not indicated.
advise	These increased exposures of norethindrone and ethinyl_estradiol should be taken into consideration when selecting an oral <e12> contraceptive </e12> for women taking <e20> valdecoxib </e20> .
advise	It is recommended not to exceed a single # mg dose of <e10> Vardenafil </e10> in a 24-hour period when used in combination with <e20> erythromycin </e20> .
advise	A 5-mg <e10> Vardenafil </e10> dose should not be exceeded when used in combination with # mg once daily <e20> ketoconazole </e20> .
advise	Since higher doses of ketoconazole (400 mg daily) may result in higher increases in Cmax and AUC, a single # mg dose of <e10> Vardenafil </e10> should not be exceeded in a 24-hour period when used in combination with <e20> ketoconazole </e20> # mg daily.
advise	It is recommended not to exceed a single # mg <e10> Vardenafil </e10> dose in a 24-hour period when used in combination with <e20> indinavir </e20> .

advise	If intravenous <e10> pentamidine </e10> is required to treat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, treatment with <e20> HIVID </e20> should be interrupted.
advise	The clinical significance of this reduction is not known, hence <e10> zalcitabine </e10> is not recommended to be ingested simultaneously with <e20> magnesium </e20> / aluminum -containing antacids .
advise	The clinical significance of this reduction is not known, hence <e10> zalcitabine </e10> is not recommended to be ingested simultaneously with magnesium / <e20> aluminum </e20> -containing antacids .
